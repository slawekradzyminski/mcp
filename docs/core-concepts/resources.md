# Resources

Resources are how you expose data to LLMs. They're similar to GET endpoints in a REST API - they provide data but shouldn't perform significant computation or have side effects:

```python
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("My App")


@mcp.resource("config://app")
def get_config() -> str:
    """Static configuration data"""
    return "App configuration here"


@mcp.resource("users://{user_id}/profile")
def get_user_profile(user_id: str) -> str:
    """Dynamic user data"""
    return f"Profile data for user {user_id}"
```
