# Mounting to an Existing ASGI Server

> **Note**: SSE transport is being superseded by [Streamable HTTP transport](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports#streamable-http).

You can mount the SSE server to an existing ASGI server using the `sse_app` method. This allows you to integrate the SSE server with other ASGI applications.

```python
from starlette.applications import Starlette
from starlette.routing import Mount, Host
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP


mcp = FastMCP("My App")

# Mount the SSE server to the existing ASGI server
app = Starlette(
    routes=[
        Mount('/', app=mcp.sse_app()),
    ]
)

# or dynamically mount as host
app.router.routes.append(Host('mcp.acme.corp', app=mcp.sse_app()))
```

When mounting multiple MCP servers under different paths, you can configure the mount path in several ways:

```python
from starlette.applications import Starlette
from starlette.routing import Mount
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

# Create multiple MCP servers
github_mcp = FastMCP("GitHub API")
browser_mcp = FastMCP("Browser")
curl_mcp = FastMCP("Curl")
search_mcp = FastMCP("Search")

# Method 1: Configure mount paths via settings (recommended for persistent configuration)
github_mcp.settings.mount_path = "/github"
browser_mcp.settings.mount_path = "/browser"

# Method 2: Pass mount path directly to sse_app (preferred for ad-hoc mounting)
# This approach doesn't modify the server's settings permanently

# Create Starlette app with multiple mounted servers
app = Starlette(
    routes=[
        # Using settings-based configuration
        Mount("/github", app=github_mcp.sse_app()),
        Mount("/browser", app=browser_mcp.sse_app()),
        # Using direct mount path parameter
        Mount("/curl", app=curl_mcp.sse_app("/curl")),
        Mount("/search", app=search_mcp.sse_app("/search")),
    ]
)

# Method 3: For direct execution, you can also pass the mount path to run()
if __name__ == "__main__":
    search_mcp.run(transport="sse", mount_path="/search")
```
